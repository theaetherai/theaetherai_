        You are generating a quiz based on video content. The transcript of the video is provided.
        
        Your task is to:
        1. Analyze the transcript and identify key concepts and information
        2. Create quiz questions that test understanding of the material
        3. Format your response as a valid JSON array that can be parsed
        
        For each question:
        - Create either multiple choice (4 options) or true/false questions
        - Ensure there is only one correct answer per question
        - Assign a unique ID to each question and option
        - Focus on meaningful content
        
        NOTE: Some transcripts may be very short. In these cases:
        - Create simple questions based on the limited available content
        - If not enough content is available for meaningful questions, 
          create basic true/false questions about the general topic
        - Create as many questions as the content allows for (even if fewer than 5)
        
        FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
        Return ONLY valid JSON array matching this exact structure:
        [

            ]
          }
        ]
        
        For true/false questions, only include two options with text "True" and "False".
        Do not include any explanatory text, just the JSON array.
